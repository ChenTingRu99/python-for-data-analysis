For example, I have implemented a Pipe class that calls function on its operand by `|` operator. You see that numpy instance detects `__array_ufunc__` method of its operand and delegates to my implementation, but pandas doesn't.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have [monkeypatched](https://github.com/sspipe/sspipe/blob/eb4f8ef2a618307288a8e093059521163b93279c/sspipe/patch.py#L6-L32) this operator in [sspipe](https://github.com/sspipe/sspipe) library for now, but allowsing custom classes to implement custom behaviors makes opportunity for third-party libraries to integrate better with pandas.\\r\\n\"},\n",

In the case leading up to this issue report, I wanted to create a string column showing the actual value for the group min, and e.g., \"+1.2\" for the difference of the other rows from the min. However, Pandas unexpectedly converts this column back to float64 values, dropping the \\'+\\' sign for the non-min rows. This only happens with `groupby`, not when the transformation is applied to the whole column. It also only happens if the original column is a float type and the column of strings can be successfully converted back to floats.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t think users expect string columns to be converted back to the type of the original column (float in this case), even if that is possible. Pandas also doesn\\'t seem to promise this behavior, since it only occurs with `groupby` and not when applying `transform` to the whole column.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is possible to work around this by converting the original column to object type before applying the groupby and transform, but I don\\'t think that should be necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would recommend dropping this conversion, and create a new series with the same type returned by the `transform` function.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Expected Output\\r\\n\\r\\nobject\\r\\nobject\\r\\nobject\\r\\nobject\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Output of ``pd.show_versions()``\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit: None\\r\\npython: 2.7.11.final.0\\r\\npython-bits: 64\\r\\nOS: Darwin\\r\\nOS-release: 17.7.0\\r\\nmachine: x86_64\\r\\nprocessor: i386\\r\\nbyteorder: little\\r\\nLC_ALL: None\\r\\nLANG: None\\r\\nLOCALE: None.None\\r\\n\\r\\npandas: 0.20.3\\r\\npytest: 2.8.5\\r\\npip: 9.0.1\\r\\nsetuptools: 35.0.2\\r\\nCython: 0.23.4\\r\\nnumpy: 1.10.4\\r\\nscipy: 0.17.0\\r\\nxarray: None\\r\\nIPython: 5.7.0\\r\\nsphinx: 1.6.1\\r\\npatsy: 0.4.1\\r\\ndateutil: 2.4.2\\r\\npytz: 2017.2\\r\\nblosc: None\\r\\nbottleneck: 1.0.0\\r\\ntables: 3.2.2\\r\\nnumexpr: 2.4.6\\r\\nfeather: None\\r\\nmatplotlib: 2.2.2\\r\\nopenpyxl: 2.3.2\\r\\nxlrd: 0.9.4\\r\\nxlwt: 1.0.0\\r\\nxlsxwriter: 0.8.4\\r\\nlxml: 3.5.0\\r\\nbs4: 4.6.0\\r\\nhtml5lib: None\\r\\nsqlalchemy: 1.0.11\\r\\npymysql: None\\r\\npsycopg2: 2.6.1 (dt dec pq3 ext lo64)\\r\\njinja2: 2.9.6\\r\\ns3fs: None\\r\\npandas_gbq: None\\r\\npandas_datareader: None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n'},\n",

       "  'body': '#### Code Sample\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the code sample below: column \"A\" consists entirely of numbers formatted as strings.\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\"A\": [\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"]})\\r\\ndf.convert_objects(convert_numeric=True).dtypes\\r\\ndf.infer_objects().dtypes\\r\\n```\\r\\n#### Problem description\\r\\nAt present, I am using the convert_objects function to convert any columns which are entirely made up of numbers formatted as strings, to numeric values if possible. I note that the convert_objects function is deprecated, so I attempted to update my code to use infer_objects instead. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the infer_objects function appears to work differently, and will only convert a column to a numeric type if all rows in a particular column are numbers, but the series was previously configured in the dataframe (as shown in the [example](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.infer_objects.html))\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand the conversion of columns consisting entirely of string formatted numbers to numeric types may not be desirable for the default behavior, however it would be handy to give an argument which allows either behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternatively, one must loop through each column and attempt conversion using the to_numeric function.\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Expected Output\\r\\n```python\\r\\n# output from df.convert_objects(convert_numeric=True).dtypes\\r\\nA    int64\\r\\ndtype: object\\r\\n\\r\\n# output from df.infer_objects().dtypes\\r\\nA    object\\r\\ndtype: object\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Output of ``pd.show_versions()``\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit: None\\r\\npython: 3.6.3.final.0\\r\\npython-bits: 64\\r\\nOS: Windows\\r\\nOS-release: 10\\r\\nmachine: AMD64\\r\\nprocessor: Intel64 Family 6 Model 58 Stepping 9, GenuineIntel\\r\\nbyteorder: little\\r\\nLC_ALL: None\\r\\nLANG: en\\r\\nLOCALE: None.None\\r\\n\\r\\npandas: 0.23.1\\r\\npytest: 3.2.1\\r\\npip: 18.0\\r\\nsetuptools: 36.5.0.post20170921\\r\\nCython: 0.26.1\\r\\nnumpy: 1.13.3\\r\\nscipy: 0.19.1\\r\\npyarrow: None\\r\\nxarray: None\\r\\nIPython: 6.4.0\\r\\nsphinx: 1.6.3\\r\\npatsy: 0.4.1\\r\\ndateutil: 2.6.1\\r\\npytz: 2017.2\\r\\nblosc: None\\r\\nbottleneck: 1.2.1\\r\\ntables: 3.4.2\\r\\nnumexpr: 2.6.2\\r\\nfeather: None\\r\\nmatplotlib: 2.2.2\\r\\nopenpyxl: 2.4.8\\r\\nxlrd: 1.1.0\\r\\nxlwt: 1.3.0\\r\\nxlsxwriter: 1.0.2\\r\\nlxml: 4.1.0\\r\\nbs4: 4.6.0\\r\\nhtml5lib: 0.999999999\\r\\nsqlalchemy: 1.1.13\\r\\npymysql: None\\r\\npsycopg2: None\\r\\njinja2: 2.9.6\\r\\ns3fs: None\\r\\nfastparquet: None\\r\\npandas_gbq: None\\r\\npandas_datareader: None\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n'},\n",
